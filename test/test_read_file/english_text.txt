Dear Lady,

How are you?  I am doing fine but I miss you.  We will see each other in heaven again though.  I am working with some really talented hackers right now that will get me through the next month and then everything will be fine and I can't wait but anyway stay healthy and I will see you again in a happy place.

Cheers!
